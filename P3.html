		<i>I can't explain but I wanna try <br>
		There's this image of you and I <br>
		And it goes dancing by <br>
	    In the morning and in the night time <br> </i>
	</p>
	<p> <strong>
		There's all these secrets that I can't keep <br>
		Like in my heart there's that hotel suite <br>
		And you lived there so long <br>
		It's kinda strange, now you're gone <br>
	</strong></p>
	<p> <i>
		I'm not sure if I should <br>
		(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found <br>
		Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing <br>
		And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
	</i></p>
	<p>
		There's all those places we used to go <br>
		And I suspect you already know <br>
		But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same <br>
		But something about it's changed <br>
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not sure if I should <br>
		(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found <br>
		Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing <br>
		And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
	</p>
	<p>
		And I thought I was yours (shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Forever (shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Or maybe I was mistaken (shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		But I just cannot manage (shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		o make it through the day (shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Without thinking of you lately
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not sure if I should <br>
		(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) Show you what I've found <br>
		Has it gone for good? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Or is it coming back around? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		Isn't it hard to make up your mind? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
		(Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) When you're losing <br>
		And your fuse is fireside? (Shoo-wop, shoo-wop) <br>
